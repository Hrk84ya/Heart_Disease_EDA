# Heart Disease Analysis

This repository contains Python code to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to heart disease. The code utilizes various visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python modules installed:

- os
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn

You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:Hrk84ya/Heart_Disease_EDA.git
```
2. Navigate to the repository directory
```
cd Heart_Disease_EDA
```
3. Run the ipynb file
```
Heart_Disease_Analysis.ipynb
```
## Description
The ipynb file "heart_disease_analysis.py" performs the following tasks:

- Import necessary modules
- Read the heart disease dataset from a CSV file
- Plot the distribution of 'Age', 'RestingBP', 'Cholesterol', and 'MaxHR' using kernel density estimate (KDE) plots
- Create pie charts to visualize the count of each 'Sex', 'ChestPainType', 'RestingECG', and 'HeartDisease' category
- Create violin plots to visualize the distribution of 'Age' and 'HeartDisease' status across different 'Sex' categories
- Create a pair plot to visualize pairwise relationships and distributions for all numerical columns in the dataset
- Create joint plots to visualize relationships between various columns using hexagonal bins or regression lines

## Example Output
Here is an example of the output generated by the script:

- Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plots for 'Age', 'RestingBP', 'Cholesterol', and 'MaxHR'
- Pie charts for the 'Sex', 'ChestPainType', 'RestingECG', and 'HeartDisease' categories
- Violin plots for 'Age' and 'HeartDisease' across different 'Sex' categories
- Pair plot showing pairwise relationships and distributions
- Joint plots showing relationships between various columns
